## Introduction

This dissertation, titled "The Mechanism of Meditation: A Study on the Components and Covariates of a Single Meditation Session", mainly explores whether a single brief meditation practice can enhance well-being (operationalized as reduction of state stress and anxiety), and further examines the underlying mechanisms (expectations and thought valence) and situational factors. The author designed four experiments, comparing meditation condition with control condition (using ANCOVA), different components of the meditation, testing placebo and labeling effects, and conducting exploratory analysis at the end. The conclusion is that even a single-session meditation can bring about a considerable improvement in well-being. Moreover, expectations and thought valence play an important role in this process. The research results of the first chapter show that a 20-minute mindfulness meditation can significantly reduce state stress and state anxiety, with better effects than the control group. At the same time, meditation is more effective on dealing with negative thought than relaxation exercises. 

** Apart from all the preparatory analyses, what I aim to replicate is the outcome related to the meditation mechanism. That is, the interaction effects between thought valence/expectation and conditions on state stress and anxiety reduction. **  

In addition, apart from using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), I also plan to attempt using ANOVA to separately incorporate the pre-test and post-test as independent variables (instead of combining them into one variable) to examine the effect of meditation, as well as the role of thought valence and expectation within it.

### Justification for choice of study

The main reason is related to my research interests. I am currently focusing on how to promote people’s well-being, using either changing thought valence by meditation or the reducting death anxiety. Dr. Bondi’s research provides clear and rigorous analysis on how meditation reduce state stress and anxiety, and what role thought valence plays in this process. Her result suggests that meditation is good at dealing with negative thoughts, which can contribute to well-being. The most interesting thing is she failed to replicate the result by herself in the second experiment. I tend to discuss the mechanistic role of thought valence in the effects of being present, as a component of meditation, on well-being within the experimental control and manipulation design of the first year project. Therefore, I have to confirm that thought valence has real effect on well-being. 

### Anticipated challenges

1. Due to the incomplete information of the variables reported in the study, I would like to seek the original data from the authors of the paper in order to generate the simulation data.
2. For some variables, it might be necessary to assume that the data follows a normal distribution.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

#### Data Generation 

The data will be generated based on Python. I will generate the data based on the mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient provided in the original article. The level of detail in the data will be down to every participant's each reaction. The questionnaire used in the original experiment, including demographical information (3 items), state anxiety and trait anxiety (40 items * twice measuring), state stress (3 items * twice measuring), expectation (1 item), thought (5 items), mindfulness (15 items), previous meditation experience (1), chronic stress (10 items), loneliness (20 items), enjoyment(1 item), and insight(1 item). Additionally, in terms of the sequence of data generation, I plan to complete the generation of the main variables (i.e., the calculated average scores of the questionnaires) first, and then generate the scores for each item based on the main variables.  

#### Data Analysis



### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
